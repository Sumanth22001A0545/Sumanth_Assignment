What is Git?

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. 
It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 
It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers.
The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.



What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.
Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.


What Is Version Control?
Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code.
As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…
At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project.
If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase,
it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.
Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.



Repository:
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. 
You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
When you create a repository, you can choose to make the repository public or private.
Repositories in organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and are owned by an enterprise account can also be created with internal visibility.



How are softwares are using github?
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code.
The distributed version control tool is used for source code management.
It allows multiple developers to work together.
It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.

Description of programs:

1. Counting different types of characters in a given paragraph (countingtypesoflettersinpython.py):
    This program is to count the number of vowels, consonants, digits and special characters in the given text.
    This works on the principle of if and elif statements. If the character of the text is a vowel then vowel count increases by 1 and similar in the case of digits,special characters. If the character is none of digits, vowels, special characters, it is considered as consoants. The count of individual character increases according to the given text.
    
2. list operations in python (listoperationsinpython.py):
    Given a list in python, it is essesntial to know how to manipulate and operate the list. 
    If we had to add and remove elements we use append(),insert() etc.. and pop() respectively.This  program doesnot take any input because the list is already declared in the program. We can observe different types of manipulations that has been done to the list in this program. For example, adding an element at the required index, modifying an element of the list, sorting the list etc...
    
3. palindrome number (palindromenumber.py):
    This program is used to check whether a given number is palindrome or not
    This program expects an input from the user.
    We know that the numbers which have same value eventhough after reversing them are known as palindrome numbers. For example, 121 has a value of 121 only eventhough we reverse it. But, 123 has a value of 321 if we reverse it. So, 123 is not a palindrome number.. and 121 is a palindrome number.
    
4. Python calc (pythoncalc.py):
    This is a simple program that is used to operate two numbers through arithmetic operations.
    This program expects three inputs from the user. Where one is to declare the operation and other two are the numbers that have to be operated.
    It adds two numbers if we give the operation index as 1
    It subtracts two numbers if we give the operation index as 2
    It multiplies two numebrs if we give the operation index as 3
    It divides two numbers if we give the operation index as 4
    If any other number other than 1,2,3,4 is given as operation index, It returns a message showing 'Invalid number entered. Please try again'
    
5. Python leap (pythonleap.py):
    This program is used to check whether the entered year is a leap year.
    We know that, if the year is divisible by 400 then its a leap year. If, the year is not divisible by 400 and divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year. If the year is not divisible by both 400 and 100, and is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year.
    This program expects an input from the user.(i.e., year)
    
6. Python max min (pythonmaxmin.py):
    This program is used to check the maximum number and minimum number in the given set of three numbers.
    
7. Palindrome String (pythonpalindrome.py):
    This program is to check whether the given string is palindrome.
    We know that, If the spelling of a particular word (or) string is same eventhough it is reversed (or) read from the other end, then the string is said to be a palindrome string.
    This program gives a clear output that shows whether the given string is palindrome or not.
    
8. Prime (pythonprime.py):
    This program is used to check whether the given number is a prime number or not.
    This program expects as input from the user which specifies the number that is being checked.
    If a number has more than two factors, then it is not a prime number. If it has only two factors(i.e., 1 and itself) then it is a prime number.
    
9. Scientific Calc (scientificcalc.py):
    This program is an advanced calculator that performs vast number of operations according to the given input.
    It performs trigonometric operations also.
    It also expects two to three inputs based the type of operation that we perform using this. One is for determining the operation and the remaining are the operands that are being operated.
    
10. String handling functions of C in python (stringhandlingfunctionsinpython.py):
    This program consists of five string handling functions of C that are coded in python without using built-in functions of python.
    string handling functions are the functions that are used to manipulate the string acccording to the requirement. If we need to find the length of the string, we use strlen(), if we want to reverse the string we use strrev(), if we want to compare two strings we use strcmp(), if we want to concatenate two strings we use strcat() snd if we want to copy a string to another string we use strcpy().
